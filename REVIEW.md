## 🎬 Presentation Talking Points

### Opening (Context Setting)
"I analyzed 4 years of global retail data—over 51,000 transactions across 13 regions—to identify revenue optimization opportunities and demonstrate how I approach product problems with data."

### The Problem
"While the business showed healthy 10.2% monthly growth, I discovered a critical margin issue: Southeast Asia's Furniture segment operates at -2.3% margins while Canada achieves 26.6% in the same category. This represents a $217K profit opportunity."

### The Analysis Approach
"I built a Python analytics pipeline using Pandas and Plotly to:
1. Clean and standardize 51K transaction records
2. Calculate PM metrics (MRR, CAC, margin by region/category)
3. Segment customers by purchase frequency and value
4. Identify root causes through regional benchmarking"

### Key Insight #1: Regional Pricing Gap
"The 24.6% margin gap between Southeast Asia and Canada in Furniture indicates either pricing is too low, costs are too high, or discount strategy needs adjustment in the underperforming region."

### Key Insight #2: Power User Economics
"20% of customers generate 43.5% of revenue. These power users spend 3x more ($17K vs $5.6K) and maintain higher margins. Retention strategy should prioritize this segment."

### The Recommendations
"Four actionable strategies emerged:
1. **Regional pricing strategy** - Address Southeast Asia's negative furniture margins through price optimization or cost reduction
2. **Power user focus** - Build retention programs for high-frequency customers
3. **Category-specific optimization** - Leverage Technology's strong performance ($663K profit)
4. **Supply chain review** - Investigate why Southeast Asia costs are 24% higher than benchmarks"

### The Business Impact
"By fixing the Southeast Asia margin gap alone, the business could unlock $217K in additional annual profit—a 14.8% improvement—without acquiring a single new customer."

### Closing (Skills Demonstrated)
"This project showcases my ability to:
- Work with enterprise-scale datasets (51K+ records)
- Calculate and interpret business metrics (MRR, CAC, margin analysis)
- Identify problems through data (regional benchmarking)
- Quantify opportunities ($217K with 14.8% ROI)
- Translate analysis into actionable recommendations
- Build interactive visualizations for stakeholder communication"
